Subject: x86: Disable the use of auto-translated PV guests

This is a minimal backport of c/s 92942fd3d469 "x86/mm: drop
guest_{map,get_eff}_l1e() hooks" from Xen 4.7, which stated:

  Disallow the unmaintained and presumed broken translated-but-not-external
  paging mode combination ...

It turns out that this mode is insecure to run with, as opposed to just simply
broken.

This is part of XSA-243.
