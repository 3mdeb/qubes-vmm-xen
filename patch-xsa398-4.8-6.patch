Subject: [PATCH] x86/spec-ctrl: Cease using thunk=lfence on AMD

AMD have updated their Spectre v2 guidance, and lfence/jmp is no longer
considered safe.  AMD are recommending using retpoline everywhere.

Update the default heuristics to never select THUNK_LFENCE.

This is part of XSA-398 / CVE-2021-26401.

 If Xen was compiled with INDIRECT_THUNK support, `thunk=` can be used to
 select which of the thunks gets patched into the `__x86_indirect_thunk_%reg`

-hardware), with the alternatives being `jmp` (a `jmp *%reg` gadget, minimal
-overhead), and `lfence` (an `lfence; jmp *%reg` gadget, preferred for AMD).

 On hardware supporting IBRS, the `ibrs=` option can be used to force or
 prevent Xen using the feature itself.  If Xen is not using IBRS itself,
