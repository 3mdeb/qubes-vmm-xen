+Toolstack to Linux ioemu stubdomain protocol
+--------------------------------------------
+
+This section describe communication protocol between toolstack and
+qemu-upstream running in Linux stubdomain. The protocol include
+expectations of both stubdomain, and qemu.
+
+Setup (done by toolstack, expected by stubdomain):
+ - Block devices for target domain are connected as PV disks to stubdomain,
+   according to configuration order, starting with xvda
+ - Network devices for target domain are connected as PV nics to stubdomain,
+   according to configuration order, starting with 0
+ - [not implemented] if graphics output is expected, VFB and VKB devices are set for stubdomain
+   (its backend is responsible for exposing them using appropriate protocol
+   like VNC or Spice)
+ - other target domain's devices are not connected at this point to stubdomain
+   (may be hot-plugged later)
+ - QEMU command line is stored in
+   /vm/<target-uuid>/image/dmargs xenstore dir, each argument as separate key
+   in form /vm/<target-uuid>/image/dmargs/NNN, where NNN is 0-padded argument
+   number
+ - target domain id is stored in /local/domain/<stubdom-id>/target xenstore path
+?? - bios type is stored in /local/domain/<target-id>/hvmloader/bios
+ - stubdomain's console 0 is connected to qemu log file
+ - stubdomain's console 1 is connected to qemu save file (for saving state)
+ - stubdomain's console 2 is connected to qemu save file (for restoring state)
+ - next consoles are connected according to target guest's serial console configuration
+
+Environment exposed by stubdomain to qemu (needed to construct appropriate qemu command line and later interact with qmp):
+ - target domain's disks are available as /dev/xvd[a-z]
+ - console 2 (incoming domain state) is connected with FD 3
+ - console 1 (saving domain state) is added over QMP to qemu as "fdset-id 1" (done by stubdomain, toolstack doesn't need to care about it)
+ - nics are connected to relevant stubdomain PV vifs when available (qemu -netdev should specify ifname= explicitly)
+
+Startup:
+1. toolstack starts PV stubdomain with stubdom-linux-kernel kernel and stubdom-linux-initrd initrd
+2. stubdomain initialize relevant devices
+3. stubdomain starts qemu with requested command line, plus few stubdomain specific ones - including local qmp access options
+4. stubdomain starts vchan server on /local/domain/<stubdom-id>/device-model/<target-id>/qmp-vchan, exposing qmp socket to the toolstack
+5. qemu signal readiness by writing "running" to /local/domain/<stubdom-id>/device-model/<target-id>/state xenstore path
+6. now device model is considered running
+
+QEMU can be controlled using QMP over vchan at /local/domain/<stubdom-id>/device-model/<target-id>/qmp-vchan. Only one simultaneous connection is supported and toolstack needs to ensure that.
+
+Limitations:
+ - PCI passthrough require permissive mode
+ - only one nic is supported
+ - at most 26 emulated disks are supported (more are still available as PV disks)
+ - graphics output (VNC/SDL/Spice) not supported
+
